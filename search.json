    "text": "In this post, we will discuss about the family of apply() functions. These functions allows you to recursively apply a function across all elements of a vector, list, matrix, or data.frame. The apply() family is an interesting alternative to the for loop because it wraps the loop into a simple function.\nThe functions in the apply() family differ in their input and output types:\nNB. Here we won’t talk about sapply() and vapply() as there are similar to lapply()."

It’s recommended to use the MesloLG Nerd Font with the Powerlevel10k prompt (the prompt we will install later).\nProceed as follow:\n\nDownload the MesloLG Nerd Font pack at https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads.\nExtract the content of the ZIP file.\nSelect all files (except the README.md and the LICENSE), right-click and select Install.\n\nThen, on Git Bash, right-click on the title bar and select Options.... In the Text menu, click on Select... and choose MesloLGS NF.\n\n\nPowerlevel10k prompt\nWe are going to install the Powerlevel10k prompt. To install this prompt with Oh My Zsh!, run this command:\ngit clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/themes/powerlevel10k\nNow we need to activate this prompt in the configuration file of zsh (named ~/.zshrc). Let’s open this file with nano ~/.zshrc.\nReplace the line ZSH_THEME=\"robbyrussell\" by:\nZSH_THEME=\"powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k\"\nPress CTRL + X, Y, and Return to save and quit this file.\nFinally, run source ~/.zshrc to update the configuration of zsh. This will launch the Powerlevel10k configuration wizard. Answer the questions as you wish to customize the prompt.\nCongrats! Your prompt should look like this one:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh My Zsh! prompts\n\n\n\nYou can install a different prompt (theme) if you want. Oh My Zsh! provides a lot of different themes.\n\n\n\n\nZSH plugins\nOh My Zsh! comes bundled with many plugins that add new features to zsh shell. By default, the git plugin is enabled. It provides git aliases (shortcuts).\n\nz plugin\nLet’s add a new functionality by enabling the z plugin. This plugin defines the z command that tracks your most visited directories and allows you to access them with very few keystrokes.\nTo activate this plugin, we need to modify a line in the configuration file of zsh. Let’s open this file with nano ~/.zshrc.\nReplace the line plugins=(...) by:\nplugins=(... z)\nPress CTRL + X, Y, and Return to save and quit this file.\nFinally, run source ~/.zshrc to update the configuration of zsh.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnabling plugins\n\n\n\nYou can use the same method to activate other plugins bundled with Oh My Zsh!\n\n\nTo use the z command, you must first visit the directory with the Linux command cd. After a while, you will be able to access this directory by simply writing z followed by a pattern specific to this directory.\nFor example, if you visit the folder C:/Users/Username/Document/Projects a couple of times, you will able to write z proj. After pressing the TAB key, the command line will be replaced by: z C:/Users/Username/Document/Projects. Press Return and this will have the same effect as running cd C:/Users/Username/Document/Projects.\n\n\nAutosuggestions plugin\nThe zsh-autosuggestions plugin is a fast autosuggestions tool for zsh. It suggests commands as you type based on history and completions.\nThis plugin is not bundled with Oh My Zsh! but we can install it with git:\ngit clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions\nTo activate this plugin, we need to modify the configuration file of zsh. Let’s open this file with nano ~/.zshrc.\nReplace the line plugins=(...) by:\nplugins=(... zsh-autosuggestions)\nPress CTRL + X, Y, and Return to save and quit this file.\nFinally, run source ~/.zshrc to update the configuration of zsh.\nTo use this feature, start typing a command (for example cd) and you will see a completion offered after the cursor in a muted gray color. Press TAB to accept the suggestion or use the Up and Down arrow keys to navigate into the history associated with this command.\n\n\nSyntax highlighting plugin\nThe zsh-syntax-highlighting plugin is a tool that enables highlighting of commands as they are typed. Valid commands, errors, strings, and URL will be highlighted by a specific color.\nThis plugin is not bundled with Oh My Zsh! but we can install it with git:\ngit clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting\nTo activate this plugin, we need to modify the configuration file of zsh. Let’s open this file with nano ~/.zshrc.\nReplace the line plugins=(...) by:\nplugins=(... zsh-syntax-highlighting)\nPress CTRL + X, Y, and Return to save and quit this file.\nFinally, run source ~/.zshrc to update the configuration of zsh.\n\n\n\nAliases\nYou can improve your productivity by creating aliases (shortcuts). Note that this feature is available in many shells.\nFor example, we can create this alias:\nalias ..='cd ..'\nThen, instead of writing cd .., we can simply type .. to navigate to the parent directory.\nWe can store aliases in the configuration file of zsh. Let’s open this file with nano ~/.zshrc and add at the end of the file a subjective selection of aliases:\nalias ..='cd ..'\nalias gs='git status'\nalias ga='git add'\nalias gc='git commit -m'\nalias gp='git push'\nPress CTRL + X, Y, and Return to save and quit this file. Run source ~/.zshrc to update the configuration of zsh.\nOf course, you can add your own aliases. The hardest part is remembering!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRStudio default terminal\n\n\n\nYou can benefit of all these features in RStudio IDE by changing the default terminal application. Go to Tools, Global Options and Terminal. Select Git Bash in New terminals open with."

This directory contains the user’s main folders (Desktop/, Documents/, Pictures/, etc.) but it can also be used by software to store user’s configuration files (ssh, bash, zsh, etc.).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome vs. working directory\n\n\n\nThe working directory is the directory from which  was launched. The function getwd() can be run to find this directory. This directory changes between projects. The home directory is user specific and the symbol ~ is often used to refer to this HOME directory.\n\n\n also uses this HOME directory to store two configuration files: the .Renviron and .Rprofile files (run ?Startup to learn more about these files).\nOn Unix systems ( and ), the HOME directory is /home/username (or /Users/username on Apple computers).\nOn Windows , depending on whether you use RStudio IDE (and therefore Rgui.exe) or  in a terminal (and therefore Rterm.exe), the value of this HOME directory can be different:\n\nC:/Users/username on a terminal\nC:/Users/username/Documents on RStudio IDE\n\nAnd the behavior of various  functions is inconsistent. For instance:\n\npath.expand(\"~\")\n## C:/Users/username/Documents\n\nnormalizePath(\"~\")\n## C:\\\\Users\\\\username\\\\Documents\n\nfs::path_home()\n## C:/Users/username"

This file is used to store environment variables at the system level (so for all users).\nN.B. You need to have permission to create/edit this file.\nProceed as follow if the .Renviron.site file does not exist in C:/Program Files/R/R-X.X.X/etc/:\n\nIn C:/Users/username/Desktop/, create an empty file .Renviron.site.\nOpen this file and add this line: R_USER='C:/Users/username' (replace username by your Windows user name).\nSave the file.\nCopy this .Renviron.site file in C:/Program Files/R/R-X.X.X/etc/.\n\nProceed as follow if the .Renviron.site file already exists in C:/Program Files/R/R-X.X.X/etc/:\n\nOpen the .Renviron.site file in C:/Program Files/R/R-X.X.X/etc/ and add this line: R_USER='C:/Users/username' (replace username by your Windows user name).\nSave the file.\n\nAfter restarting , run these lines:\n\nSys.getenv(\"R_USER\")\n## C:/Users/username\n\npath.expand(\"~\")\n## C:/Users/username\n\nnormalizePath(\"~\")\n## C:\\\\Users\\\\username\n\nfs::path_home()\n## C:/Users/username\n\nFrom now you should have the same outputs on RStudio IDE and on a Terminal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a temporary fix\n\n\n\nYou will need to repeat this tip each time you reinstall/upgrade ."
