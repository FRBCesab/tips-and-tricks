Our licenses are\n irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms\n and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.\n Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before\n applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the\n material as expected.

Use of\n the licensed material may still be restricted for other\n reasons, including because others have copyright or other\n rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,\n such as asking that all changes be marked or described.\n Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to\n respect those requests where reasonable.

However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\nWhere Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\nautomatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\nupon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\nSections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\n\nSection 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.\n\nThe Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\nAny arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\nSection 8 – Interpretation.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\nTo the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable.

The function getwd() can be run to find this directory. This directory changes between projects. The home directory is user specific and the symbol ~ is often used to refer to this HOME directory.\n\n\n also uses this HOME directory to store two configuration files: the .Renviron and .Rprofile files (run ?Startup to learn more about these files).\nOn Unix systems ( and ), the HOME directory is /home/username (or /Users/username on Apple computers).\nOn Windows , depending on whether you use RStudio IDE (and therefore Rgui.exe) or  in a terminal (and therefore Rterm.exe), the value of this HOME directory can be different:\n\nC:/Users/username on a terminal\nC:/Users/username/Documents on RStudio IDE\n\nAnd the behavior of various  functions is inconsistent.

This file is used to store environment variables at the system level (so for all users).\nN.B.

This will launch the Powerlevel10k configuration wizard. Answer the questions as you wish to customize the prompt.\nCongrats! Your prompt should look like this one:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh My Zsh! prompts\n\n\n\nYou can install a different prompt (theme) if you want. Oh My Zsh! provides a lot of different themes.\n\n\n\n\nZSH plugins\nOh My Zsh! comes bundled with many plugins that add new features to zsh shell. By default, the git plugin is enabled. It provides git aliases (shortcuts).\n\nz plugin\nLet’s add a new functionality by enabling the z plugin. This plugin defines the z command that tracks your most visited directories and allows you to access them with very few keystrokes.\nTo activate this plugin, we need to modify a line in the configuration file of zsh. Let’s open this file with nano ~/.zshrc.\nReplace the line plugins=(...) by:\nplugins=(... z)\nPress CTRL + X, Y, and Return to save and quit this file.\nFinally, run source ~/.zshrc to update the configuration of zsh.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnabling plugins\n\n\n\nYou can use the same method to activate other plugins bundled with Oh My Zsh!\n\n\nTo use the z command, you must first visit the directory with the Linux command cd. After a while, you will be able to access this directory by simply writing z followed by a pattern specific to this directory.\nFor example, if you visit the folder C:/Users/Username/Document/Projects a couple of times, you will able to write z proj. After pressing the TAB key, the command line will be replaced by: z C:/Users/Username/Document/Projects. Press Return and this will have the same effect as running cd C:/Users/Username/Document/Projects.\n\n\nAutosuggestions plugin\nThe zsh-autosuggestions plugin is a fast autosuggestions tool for zsh. It suggests commands as you type based on history and completions.\nThis plugin is not bundled with Oh My Zsh! but we can install it with git:\ngit clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions\nTo activate this plugin, we need to modify the configuration file of zsh. Let’s open this file with nano ~/.zshrc.\nReplace the line plugins=(...) by:\nplugins=(... zsh-autosuggestions)\nPress CTRL + X, Y, and Return to save and quit this file.\nFinally, run source ~/.zshrc to update the configuration of zsh.\nTo use this feature, start typing a command (for example cd) and you will see a completion offered after the cursor in a muted gray color. Press TAB to accept the suggestion or use the Up and Down arrow keys to navigate into the history associated with this command.\n\n\nSyntax highlighting plugin\nThe zsh-syntax-highlighting plugin is a tool that enables highlighting of commands as they are typed. Valid commands, errors, strings, and URL will be highlighted by a specific color.\nThis plugin is not bundled with Oh My Zsh! but we can install it with git:\ngit clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting\nTo activate this plugin, we need to modify the configuration file of zsh. Let’s open this file with nano ~/.zshrc.\nReplace the line plugins=(...) by:\nplugins=(... zsh-syntax-highlighting)\nPress CTRL + X, Y, and Return to save and quit this file.\nFinally, run source ~/.zshrc to update the configuration of zsh.\n\n\n\nAliases\nYou can improve your productivity by creating aliases (shortcuts). Note that this feature is available in many shells.\nFor example, we can create this alias:\nalias ..='cd ..'\nThen, instead of writing cd .., we can simply type .. to navigate to the parent directory.\nWe can store aliases in the configuration file of zsh. Let’s open this file with nano ~/.zshrc and add at the end of the file a subjective selection of aliases:\nalias ..='cd ..'\nalias gs='git status'\nalias ga='git add'\nalias gc='git commit -m'\nalias gp='git push'\nPress CTRL + X, Y, and Return to save and quit this file. Run source ~/.zshrc to update the configuration of zsh.\nOf course, you can add your own aliases. The hardest part is remembering!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRStudio default terminal\n\n\n\nYou can benefit of all these features in RStudio IDE by changing the default terminal application. Go to Tools, Global Options and Terminal. Select Git Bash in New terminals open with."
