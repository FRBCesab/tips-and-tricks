All types of contributions are encouraged and valued. \n\nIf you want to contribute by **writing your own post**, this page is for you. Read the \n[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/FRBCesab/tips-and-tricks/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide for any other types of contribution (reporting bug, fixing typo, improving published post, etc.).\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n## Code of conduct\n\nThis blog is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://github.com/frbcesab/tips-and-tricks/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.\n:::\n\n\n## Workflow\n\nThis blog is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/frbcesab/tips-and-tricks) and we use the [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) \nto collaborate on this project.\n\nProceed as follow to write and submit your own post:\n\n1. [**Fork**](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) this [repository](https://github.com/frbcesab/tips-and-tricks) using the GitHub interface.\n1. [**Clone**](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) your fork by opening RStudio IDE and create a New Project from Version Control.\n1. **Set up** and **write** your post (see below [Writing a post](#authoring)).\n1. **Stage** (`git add`) and **commit** (`git commit`) your changes.\n1. **Push** your changes to your GitHub fork.\n1. Submit a [**Pull Request**](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects#making-a-pull-request) on the [original repo](https://github.com/frbcesab/tips-and-tricks/compare) (see below [Pull request](#pull-request)).\n\nWe will then review your Pull Request as soon as possible.\n\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n## Branch naming rule\n\nFor each post, a new `git` branch will be created **automatically** and named as follow (in lower case): `yyyy-mm-dd-title-of-the-post`. This will make easier the review process and the maintenance of this blog.<br/>\nFor example: `2024-05-07-working-with-git-branches`. \n:::\n\n\n\n## Requirements\n\nHere is a list of the software required to contribute to this blog:\n\n| Software        | Description                                     | Website                                                                    |\n| :-------------- | :---------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------: |\n| R               | The R environment                               | [link](https://cran.r-project.org/)                                        |\n| RStudio Desktop | Integrated development environment (IDE) for R  | [link](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)                         |\n| Quarto CLI      | Scientific publishing system used for this blog | [link](https://quarto.org/)                                                |\n| Git             | Version control software                        | [link](https://git-scm.com/)                                               |\n\n<br/>\nIn addition: \n\n- Install the {{< fa brands r-project >}} packages [`cli`](https://cli.r-lib.org/), [`devtools`](https://devtools.r-lib.org/), and [`gert`](https://docs.ropensci.org/gert/).\n- Check your `git` configuration by reading this [dedicated page](https://frbcesab.github.io/rsetup/chapters/git.html).\n\n\n## Authoring\n\n### Post setup\n\nRun the {{< fa brands r-project >}} command `devtools::load_all()` to load and access [helper functions](https://github.com/FRBCesab/tips-and-tricks/tree/main/R) developed for this blog.\n\nThen create the file structure for your new post. The function [`create_post()`](https://github.com/FRBCesab/tips-and-tricks/blob/main/R/create_post.R) has been developed to make this task easier.\n\nFor example,\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## Create a new post ----\ncreate_post(title = \"Working with git branches\", \n            date  = \"2024-05-07\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n**N.B.** You can omit the argument `date` if you want to use the today date.\n\nThis function will:\n\n- create a new `git` branch named `2024-05-07-working-with-git-branches`\n- switch the repo to this new `git` branch\n- create a subfolder in `posts/` named `2024-05-07-working-with-git-branches`\n- create a Quarto file in this subfolder named `index.qmd`\n\nYou will write the content of your post inside this `index.qmd` file and add additional files (images, data, etc.) in the subfolder `posts/2024-05-07-working-with-git-branches/`.\n\n\n\n### Post metadata\n\nBefore starting writing your post, please edit the post metadata (i.e. the [YAML section](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html#posts-directory)) in the post file (`index.qmd` file) as follow:\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Working with git branches\"\nauthor: \"Nicolas Casajus\"\ndate: \"2024-05-07\"\ncategories: [git, git-branch, git-checkout, git-merge]\ntoc: true\ndraft: false\nlightbox: true\ncode-overflow: scroll\n---\n```\n\n- Add your name in the `author` field.\n- Add 3 to 5 tags in the `categories` field. They will be used to feed to search engine.\n\n\n\n### Post content\n\nThis blog uses the [Markdown syntax](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html) (Pandoc flavor). By running in the terminal the Quarto command `quarto preview`, you will start a live server to preview your post as you type.\n\n\n\n\n## Pull request\n\nA **Pull request** is a proposal to merge a set of changes from one branch into another ([GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)).\n\nTo submit your new post, you will create a Pull request (PR) to merge the branch `2024-05-07-working-with-git-branches` of your fork into the branch `main` of the original repo.\n\nFirst, send your local changes to your GitHub fork. On a terminal, run the following command to push your new branch:\n\n```sh\n## Send your new branch to GitHub (fork) ----\ngit push --set-upstream origin 2024-05-07-working-with-git-branches\n```\n\nThen create a new PR by visiting your GitHub fork homepage: you should see a new green button named **Compare & Pull request** (Fig. 1).\n\n![Figure 1. Create a Pull request from a Fork](images/pr-1.png){.lightbox fig-align=\"left\" width=\"100%\"}\n\n\nAdd some information about your PR (Fig. 2):\n\n- Check that you have selected the appropriate repos and branches (A).\n- Add a title (B).\n- Add a description (C). You can link this PR to an existing Issue.\n\n![Figure 2. Draft a Pull request](images/pr-2.png){.lightbox fig-align=\"left\" width=\"100%\"}\n\nCreate a **Draft Pull request** (D): this will allow you to keep working on your post (i.e. adding commits). All new commits on the branch `2024-05-07-working-with-git-branches` will be automatically added to this PR.\n\nOnce your post is ready, click on **Ready for review** to finalize your PR (Fig. 3).\n\n![Figure 3. Create a Pull request](images/pr-3.png){.lightbox fig-align=\"left\" width=\"100%\"}\n\nThis will open a new PR and inform the blog maintainers that they can review your PR.\n\n![Figure 4. Pull request ready for review](images/pr-4.png){.lightbox fig-align=\"left\" width=\"100%\"}\n\nYour post will be merged (by the blog maintainer) into the `main` branch and will be accessible a few minutes later [here](https://frbcesab.github.io/tips-and-tricks/).\n",
