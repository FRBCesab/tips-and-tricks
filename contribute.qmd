## Branch naming rule

For each post, a new `git` branch will be created **automatically** and named as follow (in lower case): `yyyy-mm-dd-title-of-the-post`. This will make easier the review process and the maintenance of this blog.<br/>
For example: `2024-05-07-working-with-git-branches`.

| Software        | Description                                     | Website                                                                    |

| RStudio Desktop | Integrated development environment (IDE) for R  | [link](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)                         |
| Quarto CLI      | Scientific publishing system used for this blog | [link](https://quarto.org/)                                                |

<br/>
In addition: 

- Install the {{< fa brands r-project >}} packages [`cli`](https://cli.r-lib.org/), [`devtools`](https://devtools.r-lib.org/), and [`gert`](https://docs.ropensci.org/gert/).
- Check your `git` configuration by reading this [dedicated page](https://frbcesab.github.io/rsetup/chapters/git.html).


## Authoring

### Post setup

Run the {{< fa brands r-project >}} command `devtools::load_all()` to load and access [helper functions](https://github.com/FRBCesab/tips-and-tricks/tree/main/R) developed for this blog.

Then create the file structure for your new post. The function [`create_post()`](https://github.com/FRBCesab/tips-and-tricks/blob/main/R/create_post.R) has been developed to make this task easier.

For example,

```{r}
#| eval: false

## Create a new post ----
create_post(title = "Working with git branches", 
            date  = "2024-05-07")
```


**N.B.** You can omit the argument `date` if you want to use the today date.

This function will:

- create a new `git` branch named `2024-05-07-working-with-git-branches`
- switch the repo to this new `git` branch
- create a subfolder in `posts/` named `2024-05-07-working-with-git-branches`
- create a Quarto file in this subfolder named `index.qmd`

You will write the content of your post inside this `index.qmd` file and add additional files (images, data, etc.) in the subfolder `posts/2024-05-07-working-with-git-branches/`.



### Post metadata

Before starting writing your post, please edit the post metadata (i.e. the [YAML section](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html#posts-directory)) in the post file (`index.qmd` file) as follow:

```yaml
---
title: "Working with git branches"
author: "Nicolas Casajus"
date: "2024-05-07"
categories: [git, git-branch, git-checkout, git-merge]
toc: true
draft: false
lightbox: true
code-overflow: scroll
---
```

- Add your name in the `author` field.
- Add 3 to 5 tags in the `categories` field. They will be used to feed to search engine.



### Post content

This blog uses the [Markdown syntax](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html) (Pandoc flavor). By running in the terminal the Quarto command `quarto preview`, you will start a live server to preview your post as you type.




## Pull request

A **Pull request** is a proposal to merge a set of changes from one branch into another ([GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)).

To submit your new post, you will create a Pull request (PR) to merge the branch `2024-05-07-working-with-git-branches` of your fork into the branch `main` of the original repo.

First, send your local changes to your GitHub fork. On a terminal, run the following command to push your new branch:

```sh
## Send your new branch to GitHub (fork) ----
git push --set-upstream origin 2024-05-07-working-with-git-branches
```

Then create a new PR by visiting your GitHub fork homepage: you should see a new green button named **Compare & Pull request** (Fig. 1).

![Figure 1. Create a Pull request from a Fork](images/pr-1.png){.lightbox fig-align="left" width="100%"}


Add some information about your PR (Fig. 2):

- Check that you have selected the appropriate repos and branches (A).
- Add a title (B).
- Add a description (C). You can link this PR to an existing Issue.

![Figure 2. Draft a Pull request](images/pr-2.png){.lightbox fig-align="left" width="100%"}

Create a **Draft Pull request** (D): this will allow you to keep working on your post (i.e. adding commits). All new commits on the branch `2024-05-07-working-with-git-branches` will be automatically added to this PR.

Once your post is ready, click on **Ready for review** to finalize your PR (Fig. 3).

![Figure 3. Create a Pull request](images/pr-3.png){.lightbox fig-align="left" width="100%"}

This will open a new PR and inform the blog maintainers that they can review your PR.

![Figure 4. Pull request ready for review](images/pr-4.png){.lightbox fig-align="left" width="100%"}

Your post will be merged (by the blog maintainer) into the `main` branch and will be accessible a few minutes later [here](https://frbcesab.github.io/tips-and-tricks/).
