## Windows-only

This post only concerns Windows users.

## Context


In common operating systems, there is an important directory: the `HOME` directory (also known as the _User's home directory_). This directory contains the user's main folders (`Desktop/`, `Documents/`, `Pictures/`, etc.) but it can also be used by software to store user's configuration files (`ssh`, `bash`, `zsh`, etc.).

## Home vs. working directory

The _working directory_ is the directory from which {{< fa brands r-project >}} was launched. The function `getwd()` can be run to find this directory. This directory changes between projects. The _home directory_ is user specific and the symbol `~` is often used to refer to this `HOME` directory.
:::

{{< fa brands r-project >}} also uses this `HOME` directory to store two configuration files: the `.Renviron` and `.Rprofile` files (run `?Startup` to learn more about these files).

On Unix systems ({{< fa brands apple >}} and {{< fa brands ubuntu >}}), the `HOME` directory is `/home/username` (or `/Users/username` on Apple computers).

On Windows {{< fa brands windows >}}, depending on whether you use RStudio IDE (and therefore `Rgui.exe`) or {{< fa brands r-project >}} in a terminal (and therefore `Rterm.exe`), the value of this `HOME` directory can be different:

- `C:/Users/username` on a terminal
- `C:/Users/username/Documents` on RStudio IDE


## Changing HOME directory

## Danger

**Do not follow this tip if you are several users on the same computer.**

Here we will resolve the discrepancy between these two different directories by using `C:/Users/username` everywhere.

As mentioned in the [R for Windows FAQ](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/rw-FAQ.html#What-are-HOME-and-working-directories_003f) (section 2.13), we can modify this `HOME` directory at the system level by setting the environment variable `R_USER`.

This environment variable can be modified by creating a `.Renviron.site` file in the directory `C:/Program Files/R/R-X.X.X/etc/` (where `R-X.X.X` is the version of {{< fa brands r-project >}}). This file is used to store environment variables at the system level (so for all users). You need to have permission to create this file.


Proceed as follow if the `.Renviron.site` file does not exist in `C:/Program Files/R/R-X.X.X/etc/`:

- In `C:/Users/username/Desktop/`, create an empty file `.Renviron.site`.
- Open this file and add this line: `R_USER='C:/Users/username'` and save it.
- Copy this `.Renviron.site` file in `C:/Program Files/R/R-X.X.X/etc/`.

Proceed as follow if the `.Renviron.site` file already exists in `C:/Program Files/R/R-X.X.X/etc/`:

- Open the `.Renviron.site` file in `C:/Program Files/R/R-X.X.X/etc/` and add this line: `R_USER='C:/Users/username'`.
- Save the file.


After restarting {{< fa brands r-project >}}, run these two lines:

```{r}
#| eval: false

Sys.getenv("R_USER")
## C:/Users/username

path.expand("~")
## C:/Users/username
```

From now you should have the same outputs on RStudio IDE and on a Terminal.

## This is a temporary fix

You will need to repeat this tip each time you reinstall/upgrade {{< fa brands r-project >}}.
