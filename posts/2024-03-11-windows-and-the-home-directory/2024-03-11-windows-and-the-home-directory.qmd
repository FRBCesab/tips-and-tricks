## Windows-only

This post only concerns Windows users.

## Context


In common operating systems, there is an important directory: the `HOME` directory (also known as the _User's home directory_). This directory contains the user's main folders (`Desktop/`, `Documents/`, `Pictures/`, etc.) but it can also be used by software to store user's configuration files (`ssh`, `bash`, `zsh`, etc.). 

::: {.callout-note}
## Home vs. working directory

The _working directory_ is the directory from which {{< fa brands r-project >}} was launched. The function `getwd()` can be run to find this directory. This directory changes between projects. The _home directory_ is user specific and the symbol `~` is often used to refer to this `HOME` directory.
:::

{{< fa brands r-project >}} also uses this `HOME` directory to store two configuration files: the `.Renviron` and `.Rprofile` files (run `?Startup` to learn more about these files).

On Unix systems ({{< fa brands apple >}} and {{< fa brands ubuntu >}}), the `HOME` directory is `/home/username` (or `/Users/username` on Apple computers).

On Windows {{< fa brands windows >}}, depending on whether you use RStudio IDE (and therefore `Rgui.exe`) or {{< fa brands r-project >}} in a terminal (and therefore `Rterm.exe`), the value of this `HOME` directory can be different:

- `C:/Users/username` on a terminal
- `C:/Users/username/Documents` on RStudio IDE

And the behavior of various {{< fa brands r-project >}} functions is inconsistent. For instance:

```{r}
#| eval: false

path.expand("~")
## C:/Users/username/Documents

normalizePath("~")
## C:\\Users\\username\\Documents

fs::path_home()
## C:/Users/username
```


## Changing HOME directory

## Danger

**Do not follow this tip if you are several users on the same computer.**
:::


Here we will resolve the discrepancy between these two different directories by using `C:/Users/username` everywhere (like in Unix systems).

As mentioned in the [R for Windows FAQ](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/rw-FAQ.html#What-are-HOME-and-working-directories_003f) (section 2.13), we can modify this `HOME` directory at the system level by setting the environment variable `R_USER`.

This environment variable can be modified by creating a `.Renviron.site` file in the directory `C:/Program Files/R/R-X.X.X/etc/` (where `R-X.X.X` is the version of {{< fa brands r-project >}}). This file is used to store environment variables at the system level (so for all users).

**N.B.** You need to have permission to create/edit this file.


Proceed as follow if the `.Renviron.site` file does not exist in `C:/Program Files/R/R-X.X.X/etc/`:

- In `C:/Users/username/Desktop/`, create an empty file `.Renviron.site`.
- Open this file and add this line: `R_USER='C:/Users/username'` (replace `username` by your Windows user name).
- Save the file.
- Copy this `.Renviron.site` file in `C:/Program Files/R/R-X.X.X/etc/`.

Proceed as follow if the `.Renviron.site` file already exists in `C:/Program Files/R/R-X.X.X/etc/`:

- Open the `.Renviron.site` file in `C:/Program Files/R/R-X.X.X/etc/` and add this line: `R_USER='C:/Users/username'` (replace `username` by your Windows user name).
- Save the file.


After restarting {{< fa brands r-project >}}, run these lines:

```{r}
#| eval: false

Sys.getenv("R_USER")
## C:/Users/username

path.expand("~")
## C:/Users/username

normalizePath("~")
## C:\\Users\\username

fs::path_home()
## C:/Users/username
```

From now you should have the same outputs on RStudio IDE and on a Terminal.

## This is a temporary fix

You will need to repeat this tip each time you reinstall/upgrade {{< fa brands r-project >}}.

## Edit (2024/03/12)

With some {{< fa brands r-project >}} functions, this tip is not enough. For instance, the functions `utils::file.edit("~/.Renviron")`, `utils::file.edit("~/.Rprofile")`, `usethis::edit_r_environ()`, `usethis::edit_r_profile()` do not recognized the new `HOME` directory.

To fix this issue, we need to define the `R_USER` environment variable at the Windows {{< fa brands windows >}} level.

Proceed as follow:

- In the Windows search bar, type `variables` and open **Modify system environment variables**.
- At the bottom, click on **Environment variables...**
- In the section **System variable**, add a **new entry** and set:
  - Name: `R_USER`
  - Value: `C:\Users\username` (replace `username` by your Windows user name)

After restarting {{< fa brands r-project >}}, the functions `utils::file.edit("~/.Rprofile")` and `usethis::edit_r_profile()` will create (if required) and open the `.Rprofile` file in `C:/Users/username` (not in `C:/Users/username/Documents`).
