## Using snippets

A code snippet is a text shortcut that is used to insert a predefined chunk of code. It's like _super-completion_. The [RStudio IDE](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) contains a lot of predefined code snippets. For instance:

- `src` can be used to insert `source("file.R")`
- `lib` can be used to insert `library(package)`
- `tapply` can be used to insert `tapply(vector, index, function)`

To use a snippet, enter the shortcut of the snippet (for example `src`) and press **`SHIFT`** **`+`** **`TAB`** to insert the corresponding chunk of code (for example `source("file.R")`).

Code snippets are **language-specific** meaning that they will work only with the appropriate language.
For instance, in Markdown documents (`.md`, `.Rmd` and `.qmd` files), by using the snippet `![` (and **`SHIFT`** **`+`** **`TAB`**) you will write the markdown syntax to insert an image: `![label](location)`. This snippet won't work inside `.R` files.

Use the key **`TAB`** to navigate inside the code snippet. In the snippet `![label](location)`, `label` and `location` are two variables. Once the snippet is created the cursor is in `label`. Use **`TAB`** to go to `location`.


You will find a list of predefined snippets in `Tools > Edit Code Snippets...`


## Customizing snippets

You can easily add your own code snippets by editing the code snippets editor in `Tools > Edit Code Snippets...`

![Figure 2. RStudio code snippets](rstudio-snippets.png){fig-align="center" width="90%"}

Let's add a snippet that will create a new code section for us:

```{r}
#| eval: false
snippet sec
	## ${1:Title} ----
	
	${0}
```

This snippet has two variables: `${1:Title}` and `${0}`.

When we write `sec` and press **`SHIFT`** **`+`** **`TAB`** a new section will be created. The cursor will be on `Title` and after pressing **`TAB`** we go to the next line.

When creating a new snippet, make sure to select the appropriate language (Figure 2).
