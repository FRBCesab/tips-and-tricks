## GitHub Pages

[GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) is an option available at the repository level to host and publish HTML pages (single webpage, website, HTML presentation, blog, book, etc.) through GitHub.

::: {.callout-important}
## Important

To enable this option for a repository, you must be the **owner** of the repository (or **admin** if the repository is hosted on a GitHub organization) and the repository must be **public** (for GitHub free plan).
:::


On the repository page, click on **Settings** (top navigation bar) and click on the section **Pages** (right side bar).


![Set up GitHub Pages](pages-setup.png)


Use the following settings:

- Select `Deploy from a branch` in **Source**.
- Select the `main` (or `master`) branch in **Branch**.
- Select `/ (root)` in **Branch** if the HTML file is at the root of the repository or `/docs` if the HTML file is inside a _docs/_ directory.


After a few minutes, your HTML file will be available at:

`https://<ghaccount>.github.io/<reponame>/<filename>.html`

where:

- `<ghaccount>` is your GitHub account (or GitHub organization)
- `<reponame>` your repository name
- `<filename>` the name of the HTML file.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Shorten URL w/ `index.html`

If you have a single HTML file, you can save it as `index.html`. The URL will be shortened to:

`https://<ghaccount>.github.io/<reponame>/`

If your website contains many HTML pages, the homepage should the `index.html`.
:::

## Personal website

GitHub provides a special repository to host a user (or organization) website: `<ghaccount>.github.io`.

By creating the repository `<ghaccount>.github.io`, your personal website will be available at:

`https://<ghaccount>.github.io/`
